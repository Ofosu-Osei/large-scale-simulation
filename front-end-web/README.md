## Running the Frontend
1. Navigate to the Frontend Directory:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the React Application:
```bash
npm start
```
This will launch the development server (by default on http://localhost:3000).

3. Verify the Connection:
When the frontend loads, it will attempt to connect to the backend via WebSocket. You should see the connection status indicator (e.g., “Connected”) in the top menu.
